# Usage
# 1. From the Control Panel go to Options -> Directories
# 2. Change the Scripts path to include the directory where this script is located 
#(e.g., $HOME\Work\Ai_EAGLE_Config\scr-custom)
# Notes:
# - Different directories in the path are separated by ":" on Mac/Linux an ";" on Windows---also
#remember to interchange "/" and "\" accordingly, and line endings ("CR LF" and "CR").
# - Typically, we'd want the scr-custom eagle.scr script to run first, therefore it's the first
#directory location in the Scripts path.
